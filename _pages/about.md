### Biography

I am Shreyas Meher, a PhD Candidate in Public Policy & Political Economy at The University of Texas at Dallas. My research primarily focuses on internet censorship in various political regimes, the dynamics of global finance, and developmental economics.

At the ConfliBERT Research Lab under the guidance of [Dr. Patrick Brandt](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~pxb054000/), I have contributed to the development of "ConfliBERT: A Pre-trained Language Model for Political Conflict and Violence." This work represents a significant advancement in analyzing political discourse through computational methods.

My dissertation examines censorship in democracies and autocracies with an emphasis on electoral accountability. Employing methodologies such as Difference in Differences (DID) in India and synthetic control in China, my research aims to shed light on the effects of governmental policies on freedom of expression and information accessibility.

For my research, I have collaborated with several distinguished professors, including [Dr. Pengfei Zhang](https://pengfei-zhang.com), [Dr. Clint Peinhardt](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~cwp052000/), [Dr. Lauren Pinson](https://www.lpinson.com), and [Dr. Jonas Bunte](https://jonasbunte.com), which has greatly enhanced my academic experience.

Outside of academia, I am a dedicated follower of Inter Milan football club and have a profound interest in gastronomy, particularly in experimenting with new Dim Sum recipes.
